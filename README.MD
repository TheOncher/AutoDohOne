I Started this project because I would never remember to fill my DohOne on time,  
I'm sure we can all relate...  
The purpose of this tool is to automate this forgetable task brought upon us by "Mash'an" and "Aka".  
Feel free to use it as you wish, as a ready to go script for deploy and forget, as an import to your tool, or even just use the functions for something else completely.

# 🥱 TL:DR
* Check [Wiki](https://github.com/TheOncher/AutoDohOne/wiki) For Deployement Instructions
* The tool can auto report for you whatever you want for DohOne and do it indefinetly.  
* It Can report different status for each day of the week, and work on an array of people simultaniesly with one cloud instance, with unique profiles for each one.  
* The tool will not overwride a manual submit if you choose to take a vacation, or something similar.  
* It will refill an empty day if you delete one and leave it empty.


# 👨‍💻 Accomplishments:
- [x] Ability To Send All Types Of Existing Reports
- [x] Ability To Report Eachday Seperately, Including Friday and Saturday
- [x] Ability To Report DohOne For More Than One Person Simultaneously
- [x] Ability To Run As a CronTab or Scheduled Task On The Cloud
- [ ] Ability To Pirately* Generate Microsoft Authentication Tokens For Any Account
- [ ] Sync With Meditik To AutoFill "Gimelim" instead of "Present"
- [ ] Sync With Vacation Flights to AutoFill "Vacation" instead of "Present"
- [ ] Ascending into a PIP Module
- [ ] Create an Android/iPhone App for the Betterment of Humanity

\* It's Not Really Piracy, I just don't want for every single person that tries to use this tool to need to open a Microsoft Developer Account and connect his API tokens, So i bypass this requirement entirely in my code.

# ✌️ Getting Started:

Please Check [AutoDohOne Wiki Page](https://github.com/TheOncher/AutoDohOne/wiki) For Deeper explanation about how to use the CLI, the Functions and Everything Else.  

Oracle Cloud Always Free VM's on Jerusalem Servers are recommended for this but arent neccessery.   
**Remember!** The best practice is to use the cloud to upload your own instance for AutoDohOne, and use either crontab or schedualed task,
